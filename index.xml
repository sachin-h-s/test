      <description>Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. A Wavelet Transform tool was used to extract features from these images. Built a client facing API using flask and deployed in heroku    Link to heroku webapp</description>

      <description>The data was collected and made available by “National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases” as part of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here belong to the Pima Indian heritage (subgroup of Native Americans), and are females of ages 21 and above.

      <description>I assumed there is a linear relationship between number of hours studied and the marks obtained,so I have used linear-regression model to predict the marks obtained based on number of hours studied.

      <description>The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. This dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines    Link to heroku webapp</description>
